                        10.2 If any such dispute cannot be settled amicably
                        through ordinary negotiations between the Parties, or
                        either or both is or are unwilling to engage in this
                        process, either Party may propose to the other in

                        with the assistance of a fully accredited mediator
                        before resorting to litigation.

                        between the Parties) of the mediator being appointed, or
                        if either Party withdraws from the mediation procedure,
